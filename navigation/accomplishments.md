## Sprint 1

This sprint, I learned how to use tools such as VSCode, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Ubuntu. I also learned how to set up a development environment, including creating virtual environments and installing necessary packages. I practiced using Git for version control, including committing changes, pushing to repositories, and collaborating with others on GitHub. I practiced creating and forking repositories on GitHub, and I also learned how to deploy a website using GitHub Pages. I also learned how to navigate the command line in Ubuntu, including basic commands for file management and system navigation, as shown below. Overall, this sprint helped me establish a solid foundation for my development workflow and version control practices.


```python
source venv/bin/activate
./scripts/activate.sh 
./scripts/venv.sh
code .
```

I, along with my team, also created games such as Solitaire, Memory Game, and Snake Game, which helped me practice my coding skills and apply what I learned in a fun and interactive way. These projects allowed me to experiment with different programming concepts and techniques while creating something enjoyable to play.

## Sprint 2
In sprint 2, we focused on learning and practicing various programming concepts, as well as teaching a lesson. Here, I will briefly go over the key concepts I learned and practiced during this sprint, as well as showcasing the lesson I created and taught:

*Strings:* This is the lesson I taught. We covered string properties and methods, including length, indexing, slicing, and concatenation, and practiced manipulating strings through interactive exercises analogies.

*Mathematical Expressions:* I practiced using mathematical operators and expressions to perform calculations and manipulate numerical data in JavaScript. This included working with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more complex expressions.

*Booleans:* I practiced using boolean values and logical operators to create complex conditions and control the flow of my programs based on true/false evaluations.

*JSON and JavaScript Objects:* I practiced working with JSON data, including parsing JSON strings into JavaScript objects and converting JavaScript objects back into JSON format. I also learned how to access and manipulate data within JavaScript objects.

*Nested Conditionals:* I practiced using nested if statements to create more complex decision-making structures in my code, allowing for multiple layers of conditions and outcomes.

*Iterations:* I practiced using loops (for and while) to repeat blocks of code, allowing us to perform tasks multiple times without having to write the same code over and over again.

*Data Abstraction:* I learned how to abstract data using objects and classes, encapsulating related properties and behaviors together, and practiced designing my own data structures.

*Arrays:* I practiced creating and manipulating arrays, including indexing, slicing, and using array methods to add, remove, and search for elements.

*Variables:* I practiced declaring and using variables to store and manipulate data in my programs, including understanding variable scope and best practices for naming and organizing variables.

I also learned how to work in Jupyter notebooks and improved at collaborating with my team on projects, including giving and receiving feedback, dividing tasks, and communicating effectively. Overall, this sprint helped me deepen my understanding of programming concepts and improve my ability to teach and collaborate with others.

## Sprint 3

In this sprint, our class worked together to create an RPG game, which was a great opportunity to apply the programming concepts we had learned in a more complex and interactive project. My group was in charge of creating the boss fight environment, which involved designing the layout, creating assets, and implementing the mechanics for the boss fight. While we did not manage to implement every feature we wanted to, we were able to create a functional boss fight environment that included basic movement, collision detection, and interactions. I was aslo a good learning experience for me to practice debugging and problem-solving skills, as we encountered various challenges along the way, such as fixing bugs, optimizing performance, and ensuring that the game ran smoothly. Overall, this sprint was a valuable opportunity to apply our programming skills in a collaborative project and learn from each other while creating a fun and engaging game.

While building the game, I practiced many coding concepts such as object-oriented programming, game loops, event handling, and state management. I learned how to create classes for game objects, implement a game loop to update and render the game state, handle keyboard input for player movement and interactions, and manage different game states such as the boss fight. I also gained experience with debugging techniques, such as using the browser console to identify and fix errors, optimizing performance by adjusting player speed and position, and ensuring that assets loaded correctly. Overall, this sprint helped me better understand game development concepts and improve my coding skills while collaborating with a team to create a functional RPG game. I also gained valuable experience in teamwork and communication, as we had to coordinate our efforts and share ideas to create a cohesive game experience, as well as becoming more efficient at locating bugs, debugging them, and problem-solving, which are essential skills for any developer.
